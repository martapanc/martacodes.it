After a few years, I embarked on a journey to give my website a much-needed refresh, harnessing the latest technologies and the wealth of knowledge and skills I'd acquired over time.

The website is now implemented using React in combination with **Next.js**, making it lightning-fast and highly efficient. I've incorporated **Tailwind CSS** and Material-UI, which provide not only aesthetic appeal but also a seamless user experience. For the first time it also features a dark mode.

Under the hood, a **GraphQL** backend ensures data retrieval is optimized, while content creation and updates are handled through the **Strapi CMS**, offering flexibility and control over the website's content.

For deployment and hosting, the website finds its home on **Vercel**.
