In late 2024, the company I work for decided to give our marketing website a complete redesign. While the previous
design was visually appealing (you can see a snapshot of
it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250216055752/https://appetize.io/)), it leaned towards a more playful aesthetic
that didn’t fully align with our target audience — primarily businesses.

The [new version](https://appetize.io) was rebuilt almost from scratch, embracing a more dynamic and modern
design. We leveraged the latest web technologies to enhance speed, accessibility, and SEO, ensuring a polished and
professional experience tailored to our users.
