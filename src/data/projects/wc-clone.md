First complex project in **Python** - creating a clone of the **Unix' word count tool**, `wc`, based on re-engineering
techniques and black-box testing and using only the Python Standard Library for the main functionality.

The result is a program that produces the same output as the original wc for all known input sequences and file formats,
including binary files.
