I interned for three months at the [ICT Group](https://ict-group.it/en/) as a web developer, and my task was to build an
additional feature to the companyâ€™s **HR management software**: a portal for the request and approval of the employee
vacations, work permits, transfers and bank hours.

The UI I developed consists of customisable calendars and timesheets, which offer different views according to the role
of the logged user (employee or manager), and was built using **AngularJS** with the **Boostrap CSS** framework.
