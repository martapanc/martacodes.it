I started learning Android development recently and, in order to focus on the features of the mobile world, as well as
on practising with Kotlin, I've been reusing the Java backend of the Fiscal Code calculator I built in university.

The app has been downloaded 100000+ times and reached a rating of 4.3 during its lifetime.
