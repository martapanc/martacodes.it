After adopting a cat for the first time, I found myself overwhelmed by the sheer number of cat food options, ranging
from budget to premium brands. The research process was time-consuming, with prices and quality varying widely across
different online stores. Thatâ€™s what motivated me to create Purrfect Price.

Purrfect Price is a tool designed to simplify this process by **scraping prices** and product details from multiple cat food
websites. Built using **NextJS** for a dynamic frontend, the scraper is powered by **Playwright** to fetch data from popular
websites like Zooplus. The data is then organized and displayed using **AgGrid**, allowing users to filter and compare cat
food brands easily, helping them find the best quality/price ratio.

The tool automates what would otherwise be a tedious manual process of visiting multiple sites and trying to assess
which product offers the best value for our beloved pets, helping cat owners make more informed decisions with ease.
