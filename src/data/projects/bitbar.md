Many teams have a considerable number of processes and metrics to monitor and links to web resources, which often end up
all over the place in the browser. To gather all of those I created a plugin for [XBar](https://xbarapp.com/), a useful
app that lets you put the output from any script in the MacOS toolbar.

Connecting to the company's servers, the toolbar shows Bamboo build and deployment processes, pull requests, release
statuses and such. Now my team uses the toolbar on a daily basis and I'm currently working on extending its
functionality, e.g. to allow other teams to easily add their own configuration.
