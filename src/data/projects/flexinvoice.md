Having recently started working as a freelancer with my own company, the need emerged to bill clients via tailored
invoices, for both my use and my collaborators'.

Since I found a basic Word-based template a bit too simple for my needs, and at the same time I didn't want to find a
complete product, I quickly came up with my own solution: a **React template** that gets populated by **JSON** data,
from which I generate a PDF using **Puppeteer**.

Currently, I'm developing a data input service to streamline the process. This additional feature will automate data
gathering for the template, which typically changes infrequently and predictably, with the goal to automate invoicing as
much as possible.
