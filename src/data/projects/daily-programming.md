They say "Practice makes perfect", and that's why a good programmer should write code every day.

The way I like to practise, when I don't have more complex projects to work on, is to pick a coding challenge (e.g.
from [r/dailyProgrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), ...),
or simply to think of a problem I want to tackle, and write my solution for it. This repository is a collection of all
such challenges.
