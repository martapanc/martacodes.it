My BSc graduation project: I developed an heuristic algorithm that parses the so-called "SATD methods", that is Java
methods that are affected by "Self-Admitted Technical Debt", instances of **Technical Debt** that the developers
self-documented in the form of comments.

The research then analysed how such methods evolve from the moment the comment was introduced through Version Control
and, based on the bugs reported in the code's issue tracker, how the presence of technical debt affects the amount of
bugs on average.
