As a part of the Graduate Scheme at Booking.com, I joined the team that develops the **"Premium" insurance product**,
which offers exclusive benefits to the customer such as skipping the line at the car pickup counter, a lower deposit, no
credit card required and a dedicated support helpline.

We built the UI in React, developing various components (a comparison of the available insurance options for the car
details page, a few upsell banners and information sections) that we then integrated in the main webapp.
