A full **Restaurant Manager webapp** in Java is the final project my team developed for the _Internet & Mobile Services_
course: it allows customers to reserve a table or to book a takeaway order, and the restaurant managers to verify the
status of the reservations and orders, add and remove takeaway meals and check other employees' accounts, mostly in the
form of CRUD tables.

I've recently made a v2 in Spring and deployed it on Heroku - [check it out](https://werners-restaurant.herokuapp.com/)!
