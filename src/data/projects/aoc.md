I've been participating actively in the Advent of Code challenges since 2020, and after finishing the 2020 event, I
decided to go back and solve all puzzles from the past years.

I succeeded in a few weeks, and now I'm quite proud of my shiny 500 stars ⭐ (apparently only ~1050 people managed
to achieve the 'all stars' status) — not to mention the huge progress I've made with Kotlin, complex algorithms
and problem solving in general.

As a side project, I've also put together an API that automatically sets up a new class for the new daily challenge and
downloads the input data, and automatically fetches the star progress from my account to update the Readme.
