What to do when your energy supplier offers a live balance of the energy usage in your account and you wish to monitor
it to know how much you're spending, but at the same time you don't want to login every few hours? For me it was the
perfect chance to learn web scraping with Python.

The result is a script that logs in to my account, calls the supplier's API at the desired time intervals and saves the
results.

A simple task, but a meaningful achievement and a fun way to apply coding skills to a real-life problem.
