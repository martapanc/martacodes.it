A day of December 2014, four UniBZ computer science and design students were sent to the smallest town in South Tyrol,
**Glorenza-Glurns**, with a challenge from their professors: find innovative ideas to **improve the life of a mountain
village**, often isolated and closed in its daily life, which would offer history and attractions but fails to entice
tourists to stay.

Our solution, winner of the contest between UniBZ and other Italian universities, was to create a brand for Glorenza and
a consortium for the towns in the area - a brand to promote the history, the beauty of the landscapes and the tastiness
of the food and that tourists get to know and trust.
