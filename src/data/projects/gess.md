I was selected (among 1200+ applications) to attend the **Global Entrepreneurship Summer School** (GESS) 2017, hosted by
the Tongji University in Shanghai, China.

This year's topic was “Food“, and our goal was to find solutions to related problems - such as food waste, obesity,
hidden hunger and food safety.

My team designed a mobile app that connects users to supermarkets and local food suppliers: most markets have an
“expiring soon“ section with aliments that cannot be displayed being too close to their expiration date. This app would
be a database listing such products, so that customers can save money and help reduce food waste, by purchasing
groceries that are still perfectly safe to eat.
