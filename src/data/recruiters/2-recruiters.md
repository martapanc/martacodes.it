  <summary>Are you Italian and/or these numbers look insane to you? 🙀</summary>

I completely understand. Being an Italian myself, I know all too well the challenges and relatively lower salaries that
many professionals, including software engineers, contend with in our Bel Paese. But, here's the deal: the numbers I'm
putting out there are on par with international salary averages - as well as what current employers are paying me.

I firmly believe in fair compensation for the value I bring to the table. My goal is to secure a salary that truly
reflects my skills and experience without any compromises. This is my little way of pushing for a change. 🚀💪🇮🇹
