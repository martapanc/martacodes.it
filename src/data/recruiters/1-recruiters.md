Nice to meet you! I appreciate your interest in considering me for your software engineering positions.

To streamline the process and provide clarity on my expectations, I've put together this page to share what I'm seeking
in my next role. This way, we can make the most of our time together.

## Setting the Stage: Salary Expectations

Let's talk money, shall we? While it's not the job search holy grail, it does matter. As much as I'd love to pay my
bills with passion and dedication, unfortunately that's not how the world works 😉💰

To get to the point: if the salary doesn't align, I respectfully move on. It's all about clarity, respect, and
efficiency 😊👍💼

I came up with this fun little tool to help you get a sense of what I'm aiming for in my next role. The numbers aren't
etched in stone, but it's a cool way to kick things off 🎉
