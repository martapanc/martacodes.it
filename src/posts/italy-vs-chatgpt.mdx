## March 31, 2023 : **OpenAI blocks access to ChatGPT** for Italian users 🇮🇹😱

### Main concerns of the “**Garante”** (Privacy Guarantor entity in Italy):

❌ Users are not informed of what data is collected and how personal information is treated

❌ No law regulating how data is gathered and processed to train the algorithm

❌ ChatGPT sometimes gives wrong information about individuals

❌ Users of any age can access it - they should be at least 13

## Reactions

- “As usual Italy is against innovation and tech progress!!” Well…
  - It wasn’t actually the Italian government who blocked the service (like China blocking Facebook, Google, etc), but rather the Garante “blocking” the data processing and OpenAI shutting it down pending consideration of specific change requests
- Just avoid restrictions with VPN?
- Other countries like France and Germany expressed similar concerns and started investigations

## April 4, 2023 - April 12, 2023 : Discussions between OpenAI and the Garante

🚀ChatGPT block will be lifted if measures are implemented

⏰Deadline for compliance set to April 30

## April 28, 2023 : ChatGPT is back! 🥳

✅Privacy Policy made more accessible and explicit

✅Users can opt out from data processing for training the AI

✅Users can request data correction or deletion

✅Users need to declare they are 13+ when accessing the app

### Started discussions about

- personal data protection online 🌐
- opportunities and threats of AI, such as the impact of AI-provided false information ☣️
- young people on the internet 🧒🏻
- privacy-friendly alternatives in case ChatGPT is gone for good 💡
- the Privacy Authority protects you even if you don’t know you need protection ⚔️
