### Cons vs Strapi

- Weird block / rich text format that requires PortableText, little to no Markdown support
- Groq, no GraphQL
- No TypeScript support
- i18n setup gave me problems and was difficult to figure out
- No bulk import
- Own CDN (e.g no Cloudinary)
- Backup options?

### Pro vs Strapi

- Hosted and available fully functioning for free. Easier to setup than strapi and no need to sync different DBs
- Some more types available out of the box (array)
- Some more options to customise the studio (e.g. group the types in a convenient way)
- If one wants to use GraphQL in Strapi and wants to flatten the response data, third-party lib is required. In Sanity a normal REST response is returned and you structure it how you prefer

### Summary

- I really couldn’t stand a few things about Sanity
- I didn’t mind doing some dev work to set Strapi up
- Strapi is not perfect, and there’s a few things that Sanity probably does better, but it was a better choice for me
